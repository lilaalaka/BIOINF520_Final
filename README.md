# BIOINF520_Final

This repository contains code developed for a final project that aimed to model and explore real physiological events using code. 

The code explores mathematical equations commonly used to model bacterial growth, compares them to real-world data, explores the effects of parameters, and also explores a bacterial species competition situation.
